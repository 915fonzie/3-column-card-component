## Overview

A simple 3 column preview card.

## My process
First started with setting up all of my files. I created my styles folder with my global and style sass files. Put all of the global parameters I put into every project. Then moved to the index html and created all the necessary sections with their identifiers if needed. After index file was done, I moved to styling all of the css through trial and error. I did my best to organize the css files so there is a type of hierachy order as well as creating custom properties that could potentially be reused.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Fortunately for this one, there wasn't any point where I got stuck and didn't know what to do. I simply got more practice with doing simple css.

### Continued development

This is my second challenge that I've attempted and I already feel much more confident tackling these beginner projects. Once I do a few more I think it'll be good to move onto more difficult ones using javascript.
